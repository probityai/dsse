DSSE, the Dead Simple Signing Envelope that in-toto and Sigstore sign inside, as a Rust crate on
its own: no in-toto dependency and no Sigstore dependency.

It's for Rust code that signs or verifies in-toto attestations and other DSSE envelopes and wants
the envelope without taking a whole attestation stack along with it.

## Quick start

Add it as a pinned dependency:

```bash
cargo add dsse@0.1.1
```

Then sign an envelope and verify it:

```rust
use dsse::{sign, verify, Ed25519Signer};

fn main() -> Result<(), dsse::Error> {
    // A demo key; load yours from a secret store.
    let signer = Ed25519Signer::from_bytes(&[7u8; 32])?.with_key_id("demo");
    let envelope = sign("application/vnd.in-toto+json", br#"{"a":1}"#, &signer)?;

    // Verify, then read: the payload comes back only from a verified envelope.
    let verified = verify(&envelope, &[&signer.verifier()], 1)?;
    assert_eq!(verified.payload, br#"{"a":1}"#);

    println!("verified {} bytes of {}", verified.payload.len(), verified.payload_type);
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` prints `verified 7 bytes of application/vnd.in-toto+json`.

The signature covers the payload type as well as the payload, so a signature made over one
payload type can't be replayed under another.

## What it refuses

Six things a permissive implementation accepts: a length prefix that counts characters where DSSE
counts bytes, non-canonical base64, an envelope with no signatures, a threshold of zero, a threshold met
by one key's signature copied several times, and a key hint used to exclude a key rather than to
order the attempts. DSSE's own reference implementation allows four of the six;
[PROVENANCE.md](https://github.com/probityai/dsse/blob/main/PROVENANCE.md) names the four.

To use a key other than ed25519, such as ECDSA, a KMS or a Sigstore signer, turn off the default
ed25519 feature and implement the `Signer` and `Verifier` traits.

## Status

Version 0.1.1 on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dsse). The rules come from DSSE's
specification text at version 1.0.2, and the tests load cross-language fixtures built by the
DSSE reference Go implementation, recorded in PROVENANCE.md.
